**VibeLink** bridges brands and creators using two personal AI agents:

- **CollabBot (for Creators)** — monitors new collaboration listings in real-time, matches to creator preferences/metrics, drafts personalized pitches in the creator’s tone, supports an approval toggle before sending, and learns from response rates to improve outreach style.
- **BrandScout (for Brands)** — continuously scans for trending/values-aligned creators, produces a ranked shortlist with explainability/fairness, and **simulates campaign outcomes** (reach/engagement/ROI) from historical data.

Built to be **more than a landing page**: it includes real matching, pitch generation, shortlist generation, a basic outcome simulator, and response tracking hooks.

## 🚀 The Problem & The Opportunity

The creator economy is booming, yet brands and creators still struggle to connect authentically.

### 🔴 The Problem
- **Misaligned partnerships:** Brands often miss influencers with small influnce reach.
- **Underserved creators:** Small creators (1k–50k followers) make up 67% out of the total creators.

### 🟢 The Opportunity
- A clear market need for **values-first, authenticity-driven** matching.
- The creator market is rapidly expanding, making efficient, ethical matching increasingly valuable.
- 67% of creators are small scale creators have between 1,000 and 10,000 followers.
- The market is expected to double in 2027 (Building opportunities)

### Novelty of solution
 - Our solution is highly novel and creative because it reimagines the influencer-brand ecosystem by using AI-based matchmaking to connect creators and brands in a transparent, two-way model. Unlike traditional platforms where brands initiate collaborations, VibeLink empowers creators to discover and apply for brand campaigns that genuinely align with their niche, content style, and audience.
 - The core innovation lies in our LLM-powered recommendation engine, which analyzes creator bios, skills, and audience demographics to suggest the most relevant campaigns automatically. This approach personalizes collaboration discovery, saves time for both sides, and ensures authentic brand–creator partnerships.

### Venture Feasibility
 - Our idea is highly feasible as a business venture because it addresses a real and growing gap for budding creators and small businesses. Many emerging creators struggle to get noticed by brands, while small businesses often can’t afford large-scale influencer marketing campaigns. VibeLink bridges this gap by creating an accessible, AI-powered space where both sides can find authentic, affordable collaborations that align with their goals and budgets.
 - By using LLM-based matchmaking, we reduce marketing costs and effort for small brands while helping creators turn their passions into income. The platform’s low-barrier model and mutual value creation make it both socially impactful and sustainable as a venture.
